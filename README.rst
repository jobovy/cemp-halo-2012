================

This repository contains some code and text related to applying
`extreme deconvolution
<https://github.com/jobovy/extreme-deconvolution>`__ in the paper
`Carollo et al. (2012)
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...744..195C>`__. IDL code to
run the analysis can be found in the ``pro/`` directory, necessary
data is in the ``data/`` directory. This is **not** all of the code
for this project as the analysis was mainly performed by Daniela
Carollo; the code here served as example implementations.
