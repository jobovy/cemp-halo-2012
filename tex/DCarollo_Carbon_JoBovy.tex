\subsection{The Extreme Deconvolution Technique}

Generally speaking, inferring the distribution function of an
observable given only a finite, noisy set of measurements of that
distribution is a problem of significant interest in many areas of
science, and in astronomy in particular. The observed distribution of
a parameter is just the starting point, but what we really want to
know is the distribution that we would have in case of very small
uncertainty of the data and with all of the dimensions of the
parameter measured, or, in other words, the closest representation of
the underlying distribution. Usually, the data never have the two
mentioned properties, and it is then challenging to find the
underlying distribution without taking into account the uncertainty of
the data (Bovy, Hogg \& Roweis, 2009b; hereafter BHR09b). The Extreme
Deconvolution technique of BHR09b confronts all of these issues and
provides an accurate description of the underlying distribution of a
\emph{d}-dimensional quantity by taking into account the potentially
large and heterogeneous observational uncertainties and missing
dimensions.


BHR09b have generalized the well known mixtures-of-Gaussians
density-estimation method to the case of noisy, heterogeneous, and
incomplete data. In this method, the underlying distribution of a
quantity {\bf v} is modeled as a sum of $K$ Gaussian distributions
\begin{eqnarray}
p(\textbf{v}) = \sum_{j=1}^K \alpha_{j}N(\textbf{v|m$_{j}$},\textbf{V$_{j}$})\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where the function N(\textbf{v|m$_{j}$},\textbf{V$_{j}$}) is the
\emph{d}-dimensional Gaussian distribution with mean \textbf{m} and
variance tensor \textbf{V} and $\alpha_{j}$ are the amplitudes,
normalized to sum to unity (all of these parameters are grouped
together as $\theta$ in what follows). The data {\bf w$_i$} are
assumed to be noisy samples from this distribution
\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf w_{i} = v_{i}} + \mathrm{noise}\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where the noise is drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean and
known covariance matrix {\bf S$_{i}$}. Here and in what follows, we
ignore the projection matrices {\bf R$_i$} of BHR09b, since the data we
will apply this technique to are complete.

The likelihood of the model for each data point is given by the model
convolved with the uncertainty distribution of that data point. Since
a Gaussian distribution convolved with another Gaussian distribution
is again a Gaussian, the likelihood for each data point is a sum of
Gaussian distributions
\begin{eqnarray}
p(\textbf{w$_{i}$}|\theta) = \sum_{j=1}^K \alpha_{j}N(\textbf{w$_{i}$}|\textbf{m$_{j}$},\textbf{T$_{ij}$})\,
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{T$_{ij}$} = \textbf{V$_{j}$} + \textbf{S$_{i}$}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
The objective function is the total likelihood, obtained by simply
multiplying the individual likelihoods together for the various data
points
\begin{eqnarray}
\ln \mathcal{L} = \sum_{i}\ln p(\textbf{w$_{i}$}|\theta) = \sum_{i}\ln\sum_{j=1}^K \alpha_{j}N(\textbf{w$_{i}$}|\textbf{m$_{j}$},\textbf{T$_{ij}$}).
\end{eqnarray}

The optimization of this objective function provides the maximum
likelihood estimate of the distribution, or its parameters. BHR09b
develop a fast and robust algorithm to optimize the likelihood that is
an adaptation of the expectation-maximization algorithm\footnote{Code
implementing this algorithm is available at
\url{http://code.google.com/p/extreme-deconvolution/}\,.} (Dempster et
al. 1977)

The ExD technique provides the best-fit values of the amplitude, mean
and standard deviation of each Gaussian component, as well as the so
called {\it posterior probability} that the observed data point
\textbf{w$_{i}$} is drawn from the component \emph{j}. This posterior
probability is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
p_{ij} = \frac{\alpha_{j}N(\textbf{w$_{i}$}|\textbf{m$_{j}$},\textbf{T$_{ij}$})}{\sum_{k}\alpha_{k}N(\textbf{w$_{i}$}|\textbf{m$_{k}$},\textbf{T$_{ik}$})}\,,
\end{eqnarray}
(see BHR09b for the derivation of this formula). The posterior
probability is a powerful statistical tool to perform probabilistic
assignments of stars to a Gaussian component in the model
distribution. In Galactic studies, the Gaussian component could
represents a primary structure, a disk or halo, a moving group, or an
overdensity.\\
%This quantity will be explored in section [].\\

In many aspects, the ExD technique described above is similar to the
maximum likelihood technique adopted in Carollo et al. 2010, but is
more general, because it takes into account the uncertainties of the
measurements and provides the membership probabilities. The
application of the ExD to the SDSS DR8 data is described in the next
section.

\subsection{Application to the SDSS-SEGUE DR8 Calibration Stars}

We use the ExD technique to determine the underlying distribution of
the rotational velocity of halo stars and to determine posterior
membership probabilities for each star. In practice, the entries for
the ExD algorithm are the galactocentric rotational velocity and its
uncertainty for each star, V$_{\phi,i}$ and
$\varepsilon_{V_{\phi},i}$, respectively. These two parameters,
together with all the other kinematic and orbital quantities, are
derived by using the same procedures employed in C07 and C10, and
mentioned in section 2. 

It has been noticed in section 2 that the full sample of SDSS DR8
calibration stars contains a significantly higher number of carbon
enhanced metal poor stars with respect the local sample. For the
purpose of this paper, our orientation is to use a sub-sample in which
the constraint on the distance from the Sun, d, and on the projected
Galactic distance, R, are relaxed. As a consequence, the data set
becomes more noisy with respect the local sample, because the
uncertainties on the transverse velocities increase with the distance
d. In the ExD technique terminology, the analysis of the extended
sample falls in the case in which all the observable are known, but
some of the derived parameters have large uncertainties. Moreover, the
lower metallicity bins ([Fe/H] $<$ -2.5), must have a sufficient
number of stars to perform the deconvolution, even at the most extreme
metallicity regimes. This request is not satisfied by the sample
mentioned above (SDSS DR8 calibration stars and relaxed distances). It
is necessary to employ the SDSS DR8 calibration stars plus the full
sample of SDSS DR8 at low metallicity, [Fe/H] $<$ -2.0 (section
3.3.2).

We model the halo as a two-component structure, comprising the inner
and the outer halo, as discussed in C07 and C10.
%The thick disk system is not included in this analysis, and will be considered in a %future paper.
Thus, the general expression for the likelihood takes the form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\ln \mathcal{L} = \displaystyle\sum_{i} \ln [\alpha_{in}\cdot N^{i}_{in} + \alpha_{out}\cdot N^{i}_{out}]\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha_{in}$ and $\alpha_{out}$ are the amplitude of the
inner and outer halo, respectively. The velocity distributions are
assumed to be Gaussian and thus
\begin{eqnarray}
N^i_{in/out} = N(V_{\phi,i} | V_{\phi,in/out},\sigma^2_{\phi,in/out}+\varepsilon^2_{V_{\phi},i})\,,
\end{eqnarray}

The membership probabilities then take the form:

\begin{eqnarray}
p_{i, in} = \frac{\alpha_{in}N_{in}^{i}}{\alpha_{in}N_{in}^{i} + \alpha_{out}N_{out}^{i}}
\end{eqnarray}

and

\begin{eqnarray}
p_{i, out} = \frac{\alpha_{out}N_{out}^{i}}{\alpha_{in}N_{in}^{i} + \alpha_{out}N_{out}^{i}}
\end{eqnarray}

for the \emph{i}th star.\\

The ExD technique is first applied to the SDSS DR8 local sample, then
to the extended sample. The first application is intended to compare
the values of the rotational velocity and its dispersion with those
obtained by using the SDSS DR7.
